      "In fitness, I recognized a gap between programs and the tools available. I crafted a full-stack app, using my exercise science and programming skills. At GORX Fitness, an early-stage startup, I helped migrate a no-code application to a full-stack application. At 100Devs in a global team, and Zen Consulting directly with clients, I built software in teams and by myself for businesses. At Equinox, I held a client-centric sales and training role. Innovation and problem-solving drive me. I'm eager to harness the skills from my diverse experiences to excel at my next opportunity.",
